disk_status.properties is read by BasicDiskStatusProvider.java to decode the values in /occ/data/system.data (disk.status.url).
That data file is itself generated by get_system_gosubs2, which should be written to output the data in the order expected by disk_status.properties.
disk_status.properties should be installed on the occ in: /occ/rcs/config/disk_status.properties.
